# 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array

You are given an integer mountain array `arr` of length `n` where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.

Return the index of the peak element.

Your task is to solve it in `O(log(n))` time complexity.

## Example 1

```text
Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
```

## Example 3

```text
Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- `3 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
- `arr` is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
