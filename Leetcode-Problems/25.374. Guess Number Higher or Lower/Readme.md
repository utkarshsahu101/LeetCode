# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked. The number I picked stays the same throughout the game.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a predefined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (`num > pick`).
- `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (`num < pick`).
- `0`: Your guess is equal to the number I picked (`num == pick`).

Return the number that I picked.

## Example 1

```text
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

## Example 3

```text
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
- `1 <= pick <= n`
